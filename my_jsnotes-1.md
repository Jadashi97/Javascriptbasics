# operators 
let a = a;
a = 1 + 1;
a = 1*1;
a = 1/1;
a += 1; (a = a+ 1)
a -= 1; (a = a - 1)
a *= 1; (a = a*1)
a /= 1; (a = a/1)
a ++; (a+a )
a --; = (a - a)

# formating a string 
( \ ) == escape character used before a second double quote
e.g  let name = "My name is, \" Nyarji Daniel Jada \" 

we can use both (' ') and (" ")
e.g ('My name is, "Nyarji Daniel Jada", also known as, "Lokose" ')
